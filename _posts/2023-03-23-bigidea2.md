I ended up scoring a 23/25 on the Big Idea Quiz 2.

This was a careless mistake. A lossless compression algorithm does not guarantee that compressed information is kept secure (no correlation). B is the correct option, as lossless compression algorithm guarantees the reconstruction of the original data while the lossy compression algorithm does not. This is a definition question.

I got one of the options right (B), but C was not correct. Option C is incorrect, as it does not remove entries with an unknown year, which does not allow for the desired entry to be identified. Option D, however, is correct, as it sorts Column C from least to greatest, removes any unknown years and removes any unknown photographers, therefore getting us the desired entry.
