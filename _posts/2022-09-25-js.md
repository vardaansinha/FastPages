title: Roster Cut Tool (JS)
---
# Program Explanation
- Every season, each NFL team has to make a series of roster cuts in order to finalize a 53-man roster. With this tool, JavaScript was used to select a random player to cut, making it easier for the Patriots managers.

<button name="button" onclick="randomSelect()">Click For New England Player</button>
<br>
<a id="Patriots Selector" href="#">Player Will Appear Here</a>
<script>
const playerList = ["https://www.patriots.com/team/players-roster/mac-jones", "https://www.patriots.com/team/players-roster/kendrick-bourne", "https://www.patriots.com/team/players-roster/christian-barmore", "https://www.patriots.com/team/players-roster/kyle-dugger", "https://www.patriots.com/team/players-roster/hunter-henry", "https://www.patriots.com/team/players-roster/jalen-mills"]
const playerNameList = ["Mac", "Kendrick", "Barmore", "Dugger", "Hunter", "Jalen"]
function randomSelect() {
    var index=Math.floor(Math.random() *playerList.length)
    document.getElementById("Patriots Selector").innerHTML = playerNameList[index]
    document.getElementById("Patriots Selector").href = playerList[index]
}
