**Starting Ideas for the Subject of my Quiz:**

1. Sports Quiz
2. Programming Language Quiz
3. Mental Health Evaluation Quiz

After lots of consideration, I chose to go with the Mental Health Evaluation Quiz, due to its great pertinence to today's society.

**OUTLINE/PLAN**:

1. Create all of the *screens*: screens for each question and each output screen for the selected option.
2. Create all of the interactive buttons for each option.
3. Utilize onEvent & setScreen to create the functionality of the quiz.
4. Create an option in the ending to return to the home screen and restart the quiz.

**GOALS**:

1. I want to be able to use a function in order to limit the amount of hard work (rather than smart work) that I have to do to create the quiz, rather than using nested onEvent and setScreen elements.
2. I want to be able to create a very short, yet effective quiz that is able to give useful advice to the quiz taker regarding their mental health lifestyle and habits.
