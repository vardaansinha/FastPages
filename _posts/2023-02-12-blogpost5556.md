**5.5 IMPORTANT NOTES**:

- When requesting any GitHub repository, a license type is requested
- Different licenses serve different purposes and can create different restrictions on software releases
- The GPL License is a common license type, but it comes with a couple of restrictions. For example, all the work used from an original source must be free and the code must be shared.
- Most times, companies want to be reimbursed for other people using their patents and software/ideas. Open source licenses, such as the GPL License, has very strict guidelines in regards to the distribution of such works.
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal License: This ceases any copyright claims on work that YOU create, and your code is accessible and usable for the public.
- Open Source MIT License: The MIT License, a very common license type, allows for the free distribution and creation of code. The only slight requirement that accompanies the MIT License is a citation of the original author's name or a link to their original repository. 
- **OPINION**: I believe that the MIT License is the best license to use. The MIT License provides the best balance between being able to utilize code, and the original creators of repositories still getting credit. On previous coding projects before CSP, I have used the MIT License, so that if any of my peers want to use snippets of my code, the MIT License easily permits that. 
- **LEGAL & ETHICAL OPINION**: Though open-source and free distribution is something that can promote education and collective sharing, I believe that it is very important that some software stay secure and only with the original company. Some companies work very hard on developing their own methodologies of creating software, and if that is something that keeps their income above other companies in terms of competition, it is something that they should keep secure to themselves. 

**5.5 Blog Post Reflection**:

1. *When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.* (DONE ABOVE)
2. *In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.* (DONE ABOVE)
3. *Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.*

For both the Team CPT Project Repository and for my personal blog, we decided to use the MIT License. The main motivation behind using the MIT License for both repositories was that it is a very permissive license, and it promotes open-source code usage. For instance, in our CSP Community, if another group is struggling with a code snippet to incorporate a feature similar to something we have on our group project, they should be able to refer and even use code snippets from our repository, and just cite our names. The same applies for my FastPages. There are many Jupyter Notebook Blog Posts on my Personal FastPages, and some of the code snippets are difficult to get working results, so if someone needs to refer or use some of my code snippets, under the MIT License, they should be able to use it.



**5.5 Extra Reflection & Research**:

To learn more about GitHub License Usage, I read and analyzed an article published by GitHub titled, "Open source license usage on GitHub.com" (https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/). This article highlighted the top licenses used (by percentage) by all users on GitHub. According to the article, here were the top 10 licenses on GitHub by percentage:

1. MIT LICENSE: 44.69%
2. Other: 15.68%
3. GPLv2: 12.96%
4. Apache: 11.19%
5. GPLv3: 8.88%
6. BSD 3-clause: 4.53%
7. Unlicense: 1.87%
8. BSD 2-clause: 1.70%
9. LGPLv3: 1.30%
10. AGPLv3: 1.05%

Then, the article shows a graphic showing how over time, the licensing percentages have exponentially increased. This is likely because as time goes on, more developers on GitHub want to share code with the public and choose licenses which allow for free distribution and usage of their code. In this graphic, it shows that in 2008, there were almost **0** GitHub Developers who utilized any sort of licenses, likely because of the lack of awareness or relevance surrounding sharing and distributing code. Then, starting in 2013, there was a massive rise of approximately 20,000 developers who used licenses, and in 2015, this number rose to approximately 80,000 developers. Now that it is 2023, and programming has become increasingly open-source and shared, I'm sure that the number has risen to close to 250,000 developers, since more and more young people have become invested in creating software projects on GitHub.
