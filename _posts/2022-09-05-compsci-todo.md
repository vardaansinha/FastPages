There are quite a few things that I hope to do on my FastPages site in the upcoming week:
- Fix the *liquid portion* of my table.
- Fix and update the **custom color-switch CSS** that you added to your site to make the site more visually appealing.
- Update the *custom cursor*, make it function properly.
