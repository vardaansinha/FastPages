N@TM is always a unique experience. This time around, our group had to present our project in an engaging way which would keep customers/visitors interested.

Our project in N@TM was SportsGames. This is almost a knock-off version of ESPN, where we attempted to implement all of our interests in sports, such as UCL (soccer), NBA, and NFL, and add intriguing stats which would be enjoyed by other sports fanatics.

We were able to implement sorting and a full-stack model, essentially bringing all of our learnings in CSP from the whole year all together in one project.

**CSA Project**:

One of the cool projects that I came along when exploring throughout N@TM was this medical project. I could clearly see the gap in the UI design and overall programming in comparison to CSP in this CSA project. The graphics were designed very well, and it was a project that could have a lot more real-world value than SportsGames. It would allow for people to buy necessary healthcare products at an efficient cost (almost like what Mark Cuban has). Obviously, the group wasn't actually selling the products, but it was a very good idea and could definitely be built upon to be used by customers. The visual appeal of the project was also a lot better - it was not just a reused and revised Leuck Reunion template.

**Other CSP Projects**:

There were other very cool CSP projects. It was nice to compare and see what other groups in classes were working on for all this time, and all the different ideas they came up with. One of these projects was *NighthawkGuesser*. Essentially, it is a spin-off of GeoGuesser, except it shows pictures of locations across the DNHS campus. I thought this was really cool, as this was a legitimate game that could be published for all DNHS students to play.

The login page was a bit faulty, which is something I've seen across most CSP projects which have attempted to include a login/signup page. Maybe this is something that can be worked on as an entire notebook/lesson in CSP or CSA, so that a key component of many projects can run a lot smoother.

Overall, N@TM was a great experience, and it was nice to see how almost everyone had a project to show for, showing a lot of effort being put in throughout the trimester even after AP Exams.
