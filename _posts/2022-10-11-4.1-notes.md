As time went on, computers got smaller and smaller. 

Computers talk through **packets**, which are small pieces of information which are transferred from one computer to the next. 

**Bandwidth** is the speed at which the packets travel, measured in bits per second. 

There are many models to show the different protocols, standards, and data formats which are followed. 

The **OSI** model has 7 layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.

The **TCP/IP** model has 4 layers: network access, internet, transport, and application.

Examples of devices running at the application layer include web servers, where programs are running on machines connected to the Internet, and DNS, where applications are being translated from readable URLs to IP addresses.

Three Targets that can be addressed using IP:

1. Unicast (specific device)
2. Multicast (group of devices)
3. Broadcast (all devices)

*Note*: I accidentally typo'd the option for Question 3, I put that the Internet was a data stream instead of a network.
