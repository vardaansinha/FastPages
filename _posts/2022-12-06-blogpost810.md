*Quiz Corrections:*

I got every question of the quiz right except for question 9. It asks, "I want to iterate over a list until the user inputs 'quit'. What loop would I use?" I selected the options for while loops and recursive loops, when the correct answer was actually a **for loop**. 

This is because a for loop keeps running for a set number of times, which would be the most appropriate in this situation when the user is iterating over a list UNTIL the user inputs 'quit'. I said that it would be a while loop, since I thought that it was a conditional statement if the user was inputting 'quit'. 

*Reflection:*

Throughout these sections, I gained a better understanding of many different concepts. I learned more in depth about the main types of loops (for, while, recursive), and I was also able to learn more about the importance of iterations and lists. Learning more about certain features of lists such as the append and pop option allows me to automate certain code snippets in a more efficient manner, rather than nesting identical code to complete the same task, but in a more tedious manner.
