This week, I explored the ScrumBoard platform. It is an extremely useful way to write down issues and tasks that need to be worked on, and it is easy to collaborate on it; you can add up to 10 other people on your ScrumBoard for FREE.

For this week, I added three total issues that I need to work on.
