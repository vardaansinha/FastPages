I was very happy with my results, as I ended up only getting three questions wrong. 


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q5.png "Question 5")

The problem with the option that I chose is that the first AND gate results in "false", while we're looking for an output of "true". However, only option C makes sense, since both the initial gates produce an output of "True", resulting in a final output of "true". 



![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q47.png "Question 47")

I selected option D, since I was under the impression that the value of -1 would trip up the program, since it is meant to display -1 if the value is not in the program list, so that would provide a conflicting output. However, the correct option is option C, since the list just has to be sorted in numerical order. 



![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q67.png "Question 67")

I got this question half right, since it was a selection of two correct options. Option A was correct, but I selected the second option as option D instead of option B. Option D will return a 0, since the word "spruce" is not in the list. Option B would return the intended output, since the count is increased when the word "maple" is found in the list.



Overall, throughout all of these practice MCs, I have figured out the things that I need to review for the AP Exam:

1. Searching Algorithms

2. Logic Gates (Or, AND)

3. Binary and Decimal Conversion Practice
