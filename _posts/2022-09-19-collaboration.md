**Notes on Jason Han's Collaboration Videos:**

Video #1:

- Effective collaboration allows for the proper reflection of a diversity of talents amongst groups of people
- Collaboration also allows for a view into the differing perspectives of each person that contributed to a certain design/idea
- Some interpersonal skills that can be developed through collaboration include communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiations 

Video #2:

- Pair Programming: Two programmers working together as a pair; one is actually writing code, the other is reviewing the work done by the other person (watching!)
- Think-Pair-Share: Students are thinking through a problem alone, pairing with a partner to share ideas, and sharing the results with their peers
- It is important to leave **comments** in the code! Always acknowledge other people's code snippets (don't steal).
- It is important to get different perspectives when working on a design or program.


**Reflection Questions:**

I believe that my Scrum Team is not **strictly** based on the basis of current friends and common interests. 

Everyone in the group (Samit, Akshat, David, and myself) are all passionate about computer science, and are dedicated to working on our projects and going above and beyond the requirements for each week.

Our group is setup with diversity in our backgrounds and perspectives, but there is no diversity in our gender (we are all men).

Our group is best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in the classroom, as we are familiar with computer science and are always looking forward to new learning each week.
