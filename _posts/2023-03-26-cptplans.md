Currently, for my "On this Day" Feature, I am essentially done.

For the writeup, though, I need to focus on adding a more concrete example of procedural abstraction. In my draft writeup from 2nd Trimester, my procedural abstraction was not solid enough, and I don't think it would receive the points with the CB graders.

Using the data structures knowledge that I acquire from this trimester, I will attempt to implement some sort of procedural abstraction into my feature.

At the moment, my main idea is to add a feature with **visuals**, where data can be extracted from these visuals. Perhaps these can be visuals associated with each of the facts in the FactofDay table, and data can be extracted from these photographs.

Maybe there could be a separate section where certain photographs were taken on a certain day, and the metadata can be extracted from these images.


Here is my **timeline** for finishing the writeup, video, and project features:

April 16th, 2023: **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCEDURAL ABSTRACTION PORTION OF FEATURE**

April 23rd, 2023: **FINISH SAMPLE WRITEUP WHICH IS MOSTLY COMPLETE FOR CPT SUBMISSION. GET THE WRITEUP CHECKED BY OTHERS AND MAKE SURE IT IS UNIQUE.**

April 25th, 2023: **MAKE SURE CPT VIDEO AND WRITEUP ARE BOTH COMPLETE.**
