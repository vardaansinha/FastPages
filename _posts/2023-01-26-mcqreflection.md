For this question, you had to select two options. I selected the first option right (A), but I incorrectly selected Option B. After looking at the question again, I realized that in Option D, there is a nested if-else statement which provides the same result as described initially by the question (val1 & not val2), which option B does not do.

For this question, again, I got one of the options correct (option C) but I did not select option B, which was the other correct answer. I did not realize that Option B was correct, because for each next entry, it increases the radius of the circle by 1 (which is supposed to happen as per the diagram), and it starts off with (4, 1, 0) as the initial integers stored which is the starting position of the first nested circle as shown in the diagram.

For this question, I selected the option C (interchanging line 6 & 7), but this would be incorrect, because both lines are in the for each loop and interchanging them will not impact any of the operations performed, and will result in the incorrect average value being calculated. Instead, the correct option was option D (interchanging lines 7 and 8), as this would allow for the average only being calculated once, therefore meeting the question requirements (reduced number of operations performed) while still reaching a correct answer.
