On our team, David is our scrum team manager, since he is the most responsible. Samit and myself are the front end developers because of our graphical interface abilities, and Akshat will specialize in the backend because of his great focus and attention to detail.

**Our PBL Project Goal**: 

Create an AI algorithm that takes into account the user’s weighted and unweighted GPA, extracurriculars, ethnicity, gender, and other traits then determines the likelihood of them getting accepted into an Ivy League College!
