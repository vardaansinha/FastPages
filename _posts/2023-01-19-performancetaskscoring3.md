        The video showed the input (1) into the program from the user with the yes/no prompt, and the output (2) which showed the result based on the answer to the prompt. This input/output relationship showed the program functionality (3). All the video requirements were met.

        <b>Written</b>
        In the written response, the student talks about how the purpose of the program (1) is for "entertainment" and "to make a decision". Then, it talks about the program's input & output (2), where the user puts in either rock, paper, or scissors and gets an output of a win, loss, or draw based on that input. The program's functionality (3) is also described in detail, talking about how the program asks the user to put in an option (rock, paper, or scissors) and the computer chooses one of the random options to "go against" the user. Then, the two inputs are compared to show an output to the user (win, loss, or draw), and the program allows the user to play another game. All the written response requirements were met.

        The video showed an input (1) (text entry) which resulted in the running of the program (2), which is a puzzle related game. The video showed the resulting output (3) of the blank spaces showing up and the number of lives left for the user based on the number of times they had guessed incorrectly.
        <br>
        <b>Written</b>
        In the written response, the program purpose (1) is described as providing a game to help you learn new words to expand your vocabulary. This was written explicitly and non-vaguely. The program functionality (2) is described as showing the user inputting letters and the program either outputting the correct guess or showing that the user had lost a life for guessing the wrong letter. Finally, the written response explicitly talks about the user's input and the program's output, as it says, "...shows the user inputting the letter "p" and the program outputting the letter in the spot". The written response also talks about how in general (not just in the video example), the user can input numbers, symbols, or multiple letters in one guess.

        In the first snippet of the program code segment, it shows data being stored in a list (guessingWord) (1), and the second program code segment shows how that list is being called in a "for" statement to help the program check if the user's input matches the variable letter from the list. The name of the variable representing the list is shown and written as "letOfGuessWord" (2), and following the two program code segments, the written response explains the data that is in the list (individual letters of the word the user is trying to guess) (3).

        <td>
        In the written response, the program code segment is shown which helps to manage the program's complexity, which is by storing every letter of the word that the user has to guess. This segment goes through each letter of the word in the list and determines the full length of the word, and this allows for the program to handle words with a larger number of characters (more complexity with an easy list utilization) (1). The written response also explicitly talks about how the data in the list is "vital" to the program, and how the program without the letOfGuessWord list would become very inefficient, as each letter of the word the user has to guess would have to become its own separate variable, therefore making the utilized for loop much more complicated (2).

Following the two code segments, the written response talks about how this function works, which is by comparing the letters of the word the user is trying to guess with the letter that the user is inputting, and how the function either takes a life away for guessing the wrong letter or outputting the letter if it is correct.

Following this, the written response explicitly states the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure, which is from line 49 in the student's program, where the if statement is comparing the user input to all the letters from the randomly-generated word "hello" (2). Finally, the written response identifies the result of each of the calls, and the results seem to be accurate.

        The written response talks about how the program purpose is to provide the user with information about the US states, and how it is mainly to help with memorization or to learn something new (1). The program functionality is described (2) as the user selecting whichever US state they would like to learn more about, and being shown a screen with all of the information and statistics about the chosen state. Finally, the written response explicitly write about the input and output of the program, the input being what the user selects from the dropdown menu and the output being the screen showing the state flag and information based on that input.

Furthermore, the explanation for the "conditions" are not really the conditions being tested by the call, they are just things that the user is doing on the program. Finally, the result of each call is not identified properly.

Overall, this CPT project submission earned a 1/6, which isn't too good. It hit some criterion here or there throughout, but it never met all of the requirements besides in the first category, resulting in this project's 1/6.

        The video shows the program being run, as in the program functionality (2), and it shows the user's input and output (1, 3) as the user pressing keys, and the output being the movement of the boat and the user's score based on the keys that the user is pressing.
        <br>
        <b>Written Response</b>
        <br>
        The written response talks about the overall program purpose being to make people less bored by simulating a fishing game which tracks the user's score (1), and describes the overall program functionality as the fishing gameplay with the boat movement and how the hook and scorekeeping works in the game (2). Finally, the user input and output is described, with the input being the keys that the user is inputting, and the output being the movement of the boat based on those inputs (3).

        The written response shows two program code segments, one of the code segments showing the list fishTypes, and the other program code segment showing that fishTypes list being used for the program's purpose (when I receive End statement) (1). The name of the variable representing the list is identified to be fishTypes (2), and the written response describes that the fishTypes list represents the amount of fish that have been caught (3).

        There is a program code segment shown in the written response which shows the fishTypes list being used to manage the program's complexity (1). Then, there is an explanation about how fishTypes manages the program's complexity by keeping all of the data in "one easy list", and how without the list, the program would have to store multiple variables for each fish and each separate amount of fish that have been caught, and this would be "unnecessarily longer" and more tedious (2).

        There are two program code segments, one showing the student-developed procedure "clone+movement+range" with multiple parameters impacting program functionality. There is another program code segment where this procedure is being called (1). Furthermore, the response talks about what this procedure does and how it functions within the program, and how it contributes to overall program functionality by making it harder to catch a fish sprite with the hook, since because of the procedure, it moves in random spurts at different heights and speeds (2).

        The written response includes the student-developed algorithm, "clone+movement+range", which includes sequencing, selection, and iterations (1). Furthermore, there are detailed steps about how the algorithm works, describing that the clone moves to a random position, causing the loop to begin until it touches the hook or until the game ends. There is an additional elif statement within this which causes the clone to revert back to a position based on if it touches the edge of the user's screen (2).

Overall, this was a very good CPT submission, as it met all of the criterion to great depth besides the testing section. A 5/6 is a good score, and with a bit more depth and accuracy in the testing section, this would have been a 6/6 project.
