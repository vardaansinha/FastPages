<p><strong>EXTRA</strong>:</p>
<p>Based on the lesson today about simulations, I did some more research about simulations in the Python programming language.</p>
<p>When I did this research, I landed upon a Python package known as "SimPy". This Python framework allows for users to create virtual simulations that can solve problems, such as decidable/undecidable problems and even optimization problems, which focus on making a simulation more efficient.</p>
<p>The below line shows how you can set up the SimPy environment at the start of a program:</p>
<p>NOTE: You have to install the simpy package beforehand. This can be done using pip (which we have used prior in APCSP) with the command:</p>
<p>python3 -m pip install simpy</p>
