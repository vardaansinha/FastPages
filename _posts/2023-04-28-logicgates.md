1. How can logic gates be used to execute basic computer functions? (1-2 sentences) **Logic gates can be used to build digital circuits. Furthermore, they are necessary for basic computer functions since they need to take in binary data by performing Boolean logic operations. This allows for complicated decision making.**

2. What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates?(1-2 sentences) **They are not exactly the same thing, since boolean operations are what are being performed by the logic gates. The logic operations house the different gates, and based on the binary data (boolean), the boolean operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR are performed.**
