Here are some of the notes that I took from the CSUSM Extra Credit Event:

- Two students, one works in a research lab
- CSUSM is the national leader of social mobility
- It is very common to see people get internships at CSU San Marcos
- There are many different pathways you can take at the CSUs, including applied physics, biological sciences, mathematics, biotechnology, electrical engineering, etc. 
- There are specialized CSTEM Departments and Clubs
- One of the speakers was part of some of the CSTEM Clubs, including the Society of Physics Students

For getting into college or for using time productively while at a CSU, something very useful is to apply for **internships**, which are periods of work experience offered by an organization 
- To get these internships, it is very important to join clubs, check your emails frequently, go to CSU campus events, and actively look for opportunities

There are two different programs which can be done over the summer:

1. Summer Scholars Program: 10 weeks long, intensive research experience

2. Quantum Bridge Program: 4 weeks long, only for admitted CSUSM students

**FINANCIAL ADVICE**:

1. Paying for college, two types of loans: subsidized and unsubsidized

2. Paying back your loans (6 months after you graduate, there are options for those facing financial hardship or continuing onto graduating school)

3. Apply for FAFSA! (There is a difference between scholarships and grants)


**QUOTES OF THE DAY FROM THE EVENT**:

"I failed math and physics. Nonetheless, I never let those failures hurt me."

"It doesn't matter if you get a bad score on a test or struggle on some things because those don't really define you."



**REFLECTION**:

I think that this event was incredibly helpful for all of us students. There are many rising seniors or juniors that are very concerned about getting into colleges, especially in-state, because of the reducing admissions rates of the UC Schools (5% admission at UCSD??). Everyone, especially at Del Norte, is hyper-competitive and obsessed with getting As in all their classes: if they don't, it's the end of the world (something that I have experienced). This event really solidified a few things, but the underlying point is that regardless of how you do in high school, if you have a drive, there are many amazing opportunities out there, especially at the CSUs, which can help you succeed in your desired field. John, for instance, did community college at Palomar for three years, and then transferred into a CSU, and is now thriving as a computer science major. Through this event, they solidified that it is very important to look for internship opportunities, involve yourself in clubs and campus activities, and try your best to succeed in the things you are really passionate about. I really enjoyed this event and look forward to more events like this in the future.
