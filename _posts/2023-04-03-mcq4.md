I was very happy with my results, as I ended up only getting one question wrong. This was my best MCQ performance yet.

For this one, I should have recognized that the game score is going to often change and will not remain constant. I was under the impression that by constant, the question implied that each variable would have a constant value at the start, and then could be subject to change. This was a careless mistake.



Even though I got all of the questions about lossy/lossless and any image-related questions correct on this MCQ, I think there was a bit of luck involved there, as I still don't have a grasp over these questions. This is something I most definitely have to review before the AP Exam.
