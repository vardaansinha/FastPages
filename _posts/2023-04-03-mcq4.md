![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ.png "Score")

I was very happy with my results, as I ended up only getting one question wrong. This was my best MCQ performance yet.


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Q32Wrong.png "Question 32")

For this one, I should have recognized that the game score is going to often change and will not remain constant. I was under the impression that by constant, the question implied that each variable would have a constant value at the start, and then could be subject to change. This was a careless mistake.
