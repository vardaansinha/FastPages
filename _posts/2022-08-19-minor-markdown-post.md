## My Goals for CSP This Year:

Hello! My name is Vardaan, and I have many goals for CSP this year. I hope to gain a better understanding of **Python**, and I also hope to get more used to using **VSCode** for all my projects. 

I am extremely excited for this class, as I love to work with my team and I love to work with technology.
