My table members and I have just received startling news; the APEL AP Exam and the AP Physics AP Exam are on the same day.

Why would College Board do such a thing?

Here's why:

- They enjoy making kids suffer.
- They make learning about grades instead of actual learning.
- They don't care about the mental health of high schoolers.

This is saddening news.
