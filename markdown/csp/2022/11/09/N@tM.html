<p><em>Reflection</em>:</p>

<p>Night at the Museum was an amazing experience. It gave our group a chance to show the project that we worked hard on to multiple people, and it was very nice to have people come in and test it out. A lot of people liked our product and its different functionalities, which was very fulfilling. It was also very nice to look around at other peoples’ projects, as there were many very unique ideas.</p>
