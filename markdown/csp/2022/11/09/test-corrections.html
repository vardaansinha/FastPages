<p><img src="/FastPages/images/Q20.png" alt="" title="Question 20"></p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>For this question, I thought that four bits wouldn’t be enough to store the eight directions, and that another extra bit would be needed in order to account for the 4 new directions in the game. Instead, the correct answer would be <strong>D</strong>, because four bits can represent 2 to the 4th pieces of information (in this case, directionalities), or 16 different directions. 16 &gt; 12, therefore justifying this answer.</p>

<p>Question 28:
<img src="/FastPages/images/Q28.png" alt="" title="Question 28"></p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>I made a pretty boneheaded mistake on this question, and I switched around the 7 and the 5. In the option that I chose, the customers are being charged $7 per unit for the first 25 units of electricity and then $5 per unit for the units after the first 25. It would be the other way around, which is shown in Option <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<p>Question 36:
<img src="/FastPages/images/Q36.png" alt="" title="Question 36"></p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>I put the wrong answer, since in the option I chose, ‘i’ would be initialized to 2 instead of 1, therefore generating odd numbers. The question states that we want to store “ten consecutive even integers”, and therefore, it should be APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) as the first line of the missing code.</p>

<p>Question 43:
<img src="/FastPages/images/Q43.png" alt="" title="Question 43"></p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>A simple misinterpretation of the question here; I put 6, since that is the value of <em>x</em> after the code is ran, not the result. The result would be the sum from 0 to 5, (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0), or 15 in option <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong>:</p>

<p>My strengths included the binary questions and some of the simple if/else statements and the code execution programs.</p>

<p>Some of my difficulties included the multi-step code execution questions, but I will improve on this throughout the year.</p>
