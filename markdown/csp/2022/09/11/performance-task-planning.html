<p>I decided to take a look at some of the 2021 CollegeBoard scoring guidelines/rubric, and these are the components that I read about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Program Purpose and Function</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>The program has inputs, outputs, and a generally efficient functionality. Points will NOT be given if the program is not shown to be running, or if the purpose described in the written response is just the functionality of the program. These are supposed to be two DIFFERENT things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Data Abstraction</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>The written response has to have two separate code segments; one that shows data being stored in a list, and another that shows data in the same list being used to accomplish the purpose of the program.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Managing Complexity</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>The written response has to contain a list in the program that helps to manage the complexity (the lazy programmer way). This has to be EXPLAINED.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Procedural Abstraction</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, there must be two program code segments; one with a student-developed procedure on a parameter affecting program functionality, and another where that procedure is being called.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Algorithm Interpretation</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p>There must be a program code segment with a developed algorithm. This would have to contain <em>sequencing</em>, <em>selection</em>, and <em>iterations</em>.</p>

<p>For my Performance Task Creation with my partner, we are going to brainstorm throughout the week and come up with a plan to merge both of our AppLab ideas, and previous ideas from the Python Quiz from two weeks ago.</p>

<p><strong>Bria’s Post Review</strong>:</p>

<p>After reading her post with all of the components that helped her to get a 5, I noted down a few interesting components that I will definitely implement into my studying plan &amp; performance task creation outline:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Khan Academy Videos, which are quick and straight to the point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timing and paying attention on the practice tests, as they are very similar to what will be seen on the actual test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review the past scoring examples from CollegeBoard. This will help to guide my performance task and see how to get the maximum points on my project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cite all sources! This can be done through comments. The original creator MUST be given credit if certain snippets of code are not yours.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
