<p><strong>Reflection</strong>:</p>

<p>Overall, I was pretty accurate with my grading, but there were a few spots, especially in the procedural abstraction section, where I need to be more clear on the rubric and the requirements. For each of the sections, I need to make sure that my Performance Task meets each of the requirements, as College Board shows us that they will give a 0 if even a small part of one requirement in the section is not met.</p>
