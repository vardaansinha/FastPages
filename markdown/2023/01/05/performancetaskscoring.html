In the writeup, it also talked about the program functionality. In College Board's explanation for giving this submission in a 0 in this category, they talked about how the response did not "specify the program's purpose". Since CB will give a 0 if even one part of the requirement is missing, this response received a 0.</td>

It talks about how the program wouldn't have worked without that list and its data. College Board agreed with this score.</td>
