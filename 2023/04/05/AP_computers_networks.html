<p>The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for <strong><em>communication between web browsers and web servers</em></strong>. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts.  The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller <strong><em>chunks called “segments”</em></strong>. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection.</p>

<p>The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then <strong><em>encapsulating the data into IP packets</em></strong>. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network.</p>

<p>The “network” layer is responsible for <strong><em>routing data packets between networks</em></strong> using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and <strong><em>network congestion</em></strong> control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Watch both Daily videos for 4.2</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network activity was a very good method of practice to analyzing certain networks with tens of routes and checking whether or not they are fault-tolerant. Essentially, fault tolerance means that in a network of many different sources and destinations, if one route goes down, there is still redundancy and the network has an ability to go from the original source to destination. There is not only one path from A to B, so if that one path goes down, there are more routes that A can go through to eventually reach B.</strong></p>

<a class="anchor" href="#parallel-and-distributed-computing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parallel and Distributed Computing</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily vidoe 4.3.  Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively.  Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks…</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend architecture?: <strong>AWS can be considered naturally distributed. As a server, it is distributing multiple containers across the architecture to allow for high performance for a large number of instances. This allows for a more efficient backend to frontend connection and a smooth full-stack experience.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analyze this command in Docker: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS="--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086"</code>.   Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn.  Here is an <a href="https://medium.com/building-the-system/gunicorn-3-means-of-concurrency-efbb547674b7">article</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What mainly catches my eye here as an option for parallel computing within the server is the “workers” parameter. The workers are the number of processes actually loading the application, so if there are multiple workers, there can be multiple processes loading the app in a parallel fashion. According to the article, something that I did not notice as a parallel computing process is the number of threads. This is a parameter that is not a part of the above command, but can be added.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last week we discussed parallel computing on local machine.  There are many options.  Here is something to get parallel computing work with a tool called Ray.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review this <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/writing-your-first-distributed-python-application-with-ray">article</a>…  Can you get parallel code on images to work more effectively?  I have not tried Ray.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>After reading the article, it seems as if Ray is an application that is very useful for very large objects and running them efficiently in the form of parallel computing. It is imported as a separate python module, and when testing the running of certain programs, the processing time was significantly less (albeit for the programs tested in the article, it was a very minimal difference of 2-3 seconds), but can be much more significant if being compared for larger data sets in programs.</strong></p>
