You could make a simple simulation, define vocab, etc. . EXTRA: . Based on the lesson today about simulations, I did some more research about simulations in the Python programming language. . When I did this research, I landed upon a Python package known as &quot;SimPy&quot;. This Python framework allows for users to create virtual simulations that can solve problems, such as decidable/undecidable problems and even optimization problems, which focus on making a simulation more efficient. . The below line shows how you can set up the SimPy environment at the start of a program: . NOTE: You have to install the simpy package beforehand. This can be done using pip (which we have used prior in APCSP) with the command: . python3 -m pip install simpy . env = simpy.Environment() .

            "content": "Reflection: . In the lesson, I learned about software libraries, the use for existing code segments, APIs, and the importance of documentation for these APIs and software libraries. First off, I learned that it is very useful to use existing procedures in code, as this can make the creation of the program more efficient. Furthermore, it is important to accompany these procedures with the proper documentation, which explains what the procedure is doing and what the program is attempting to accomplish. Furthermore, I also learned more about the &quot;random&quot; module that is often used in Python. It can serve as a random number generator and a number shuffler as well, which is very cool. . Multiple Choice: . What does random (a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to b exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive . Option B is the correct answer, since the random function is used to generate a random number from a range a to b, and the random number can be the bounds of that range as well, therefore rendering it INCLUSIVE. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . Short Answer Questions: . Libraries allow us to use already tested and functional code in our own procedures. This creates a more efficient programming process. . | This procedure goes through a series of steps. First of all, the random module is imported to be used in this procedure. Then, an input is provided for the user to input everyone&#39;s names. The &quot;names&quot; variable is then defined as everyone&#39;s names split with a comma in between. Then, there is a variable defined as &quot;num_items&quot;, which measures the number of names inputted. . | Then, the random module comes into place by selecting a random number in between 0 and the number of names - 1, inclusive. Then, in order to figure out the person who will pay the bill, the numbers corresponding to the names are randomized, and the name of the person that the code lands on is printed at the end. . Coding Challenges . import random namesList = [&quot;Safin&quot;,&quot;Aarav&quot;,&quot;Boomin&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,&quot;Navan&quot;,&quot;Shaurya&quot;,&quot;Justin&quot;,&quot;Theo&quot;,&quot;James&quot;,&quot;Mihir&quot;,&quot;Aryan&quot;,&quot;Karthik&quot;,&quot;Rohan&quot;,&quot;Rohit&quot;,&quot;Zach&quot;] sample_namesList = random.sample(namesList, k=5) # here, k = number of items to select print(f&quot;you got these 5 random names: {sample_namesList}&quot;) . you got these 5 random names: [&#39;Aarav&#39;, &#39;Shaurya&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;James&#39;, &#39;Rohan&#39;] . import random player1= random.randrange(1,6) player1t2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 1 landed on a&quot;, player1, &quot;and&quot;, player1t2, &quot;adding up to:&quot;, player1+player1t2) player2 = random.randrange(1,6) player2t2 = random.randrange(1,6) print(&quot;Player 2 landed on a&quot;, player2, &quot;and&quot;, player2t2, &quot;adding up to:&quot;, player2+player2t2) player1score = player1 + player1t2 player2score = player2 + player2t2 if player1score &gt; player2score: print(&quot;Player 1 is the winner.&quot;) elif player1score == player2score: print(&quot;It&#39;s a tie.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Player 2 is the winner.&quot;) . Extra Credit Try . import random directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] start_move = random.choice(directions) start_point = random.randint(1,25) end_point = random.randint(1,25) print(&quot;You are starting in this direction: &quot; + start_move) print(&quot;You will start at this block number: &quot; + str(start_point)) print(&quot;Your mission if you choose to accept it is to make it to this block: &quot; + str(end_point)) print(&quot;The obstacles are in the following areas: &quot;) i = 1 while i &lt;= 6: obstacle = random.randint(1,25) print(str(obstacle)) i += 1 .

            "content": "In sections 12-13, we learned a lot about procedure calls. . After doing some research, I found that there are also a few different types of procedure calls, both using lists of parameters. These types of procedure calls can be more applicable to the workings of the operating systems that we use on our devices everyday, especially Windows. Below, I’ll give a brief overview of what I read about. . Type 1: Local Procedure Calls: . To simplify this concept as much as possible, local procedure calls are utilized by ports on our system. Each port on our system is assigned to a different program. In this context, procedure calls are used by each port to essentially call each other and communicate. For example, if a port number is already taken up for a particular program, it communicates that with the other programs to make sure that that port is no longer usable elsewhere. . Another local procedure call machination comes through file mapping. This is mostly related to file sharing, where files are being shared across applications/processes. Procedure calls are very necessary in this case, as each process needs to call the other in order to effectively receive the file/multiple files that are being shared. . Type 2: Remote Procedure Calls: . Remote Procedure Calls are especially useful on Windows machines. On Windows, Remote Desktop is an application that allows for one system to connect to another system in order to transfer files, share settings, etc. . Remote procedure calls allow for this systems communication to take place. From each system calling each other (client to server), the client waits for a response from the server, and then the necessary data is unpacked once a response is received. . Overall, we can see that the concept of algorithmic procedure calls stretches far beyond the constraints of Python programming, and is a very interesting and essential programming principle. .",

            "content": "3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Problem 1: Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed = Total Distance/Total Time . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed: . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } . Explanation: Since the first option uses the correct formula for average speed (distance over time) and the two parameters are properly utilized (distance and time), that would be the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. . Problem 2: James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion). That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . A. True B. False . Explanation: Nothing is going to be displayed, since there is no DISPLAY(__) line in the program. . Problem 3: Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers. . 1. totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252) | 3. totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252)) . laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon | Explanation: The first code snippet works, since the total footprint is outputted by adding the two flight&#39;s footprints separately and then adding them together. Then, the third code snippet also works, because it is adding the two components with each other from both flights, setting it as the entire &quot;calcFlightFootprint&quot;, and then showing it as the &quot;totalFootprint&quot;. . 3.12 Hacks Part 2 . Problem 1: . Find a. . c = 9 . b = 9 * 9 = 81 . a = b c = 81 9 = 729 . Problem #2: . Find the cost. . &#39;Temp&#39; becomes equal to 110 (100 + percent taxed, and the percent taxed is 10%.) . Then, it is divided by 100. 110/100 = 1.1 . Then, to find the final cost, the initial cost ($173) is multiplied by 1.1, which yields **$190.30**. . Problem #3: . Find the temperature in degrees Celsius. . Initial Temperature: 103 degrees Fahrenheit . 103 - 32 = 71 . 71 x (5/9) = 39.44 degrees Celsius . 3.13 Hacks . def replaceRByards(toprbyardspg, currentrbyards, totalGames): if ((toprbyardspg/totalGames) &lt; (currentrbyards/totalGames)): toprbyardspg = currentrbyards print(toprbyardspg) replaceRByards(100, 1260, 12) . 1260 . PROCEDURE aPlus() { if (canMoveForward): moveForward else (canMoveRight): rotateRight moveForward if (canMoveLeft): rotateLeft moveForward } . Problem 3: Which is the correct way to define the name of a procedure? . A. PROCEDURE MYLIST B. PROCEDURE MyList C. procedure mylist . Explanation: Option B is definitely the right answer, as the procedure name is supposed to have some capital letters (not all capitals), and the word procedure should be in all caps. . PROCEDURE greenSquare { rotateLeft moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward moveForward rotateLeft rotateLeft rotateLeft } .",

            "content": "Based on some additional research on the binary searching algorithm, I found out that this method is used in many other different programming languages as well, not JUST Python. . Through this research, I looked at how binary searching is done in C. . For some context, C and Python have a few differences: . C is statistically typed, while Python is dynamically typed. The difference between the two is that statistically typed languages do NOT check types during code execution (is established before running a program), which allows for better runtime performance. | C does not have complex data structures like Python does. | Testing and debugging in C is slightly harder than it is in Python. | . Analysis: . . In this program, the most important line is seen in line 4. It says, “int i, low, high, mid, n, key, array[100];”. . Breaking this down, we can see that there is a clear array of values being set. the “i” is used to iterate through that array. Then, drawing some similarities to the lesson about binary searching, we see that there is, low, high, and middle. The “low” value includes the first array index value, the “high” value includes the high array index value, and the middle is the middle index value, which we have experience in calculating (high + low all divided by 2). Then, we see that there is an “n”. This is the number of elements that are in the set array. Finally, “key” is the element that is being searched. . Furthermore, there is some utilization of previous concepts that we have learned in AP CSP. First of all, we see that this program has utilized different types of loops to achieve the final result. . First of all, we see a for loop being used. This for loop is needed in order to store the number of elements in the array into the defined variable ‘n’, and the elements are received by the program from the user. . Second of all, we also see a while loop being used. This loop checks if the lowest array index value is less than the highest array index value (as defined in line 4). This while loop also checks that the middle array index value is less than the key value. . If the key is greater than the middle array index value, the middle value has one added to it. Then, we keep going until the value is printed and the loop is exited. . Now, drawing another similarity to our hacks from sections 9-11, we see that it is necessary to sort the array beforehand. To perform a binary search in C, this array of values that the user inputs must be sorted, otherwise the binary search cannot be performed. . TAKEAWAY: . Each coding language has its separate workarounds, but there are many concepts, such as the binary search, iterations, and other basic programming concepts which overlap. . Each language can help us to better learn another language and broaden our knowledge. .",

            "content": "Question 20: . . Explanation: . For this question, I thought that four bits wouldn’t be enough to store the eight directions, and that another extra bit would be needed in order to account for the 4 new directions in the game. Instead, the correct answer would be D, because four bits can represent 2 to the 4th pieces of information (in this case, directionalities), or 16 different directions. 16 &gt; 12, therefore justifying this answer. . Question 28: . Explanation: . I made a pretty boneheaded mistake on this question, and I switched around the 7 and the 5. In the option that I chose, the customers are being charged $7 per unit for the first 25 units of electricity and then $5 per unit for the units after the first 25. It would be the other way around, which is shown in Option C. . Question 36: . Explanation: . I put the wrong answer, since in the option I chose, ‘i’ would be initialized to 2 instead of 1, therefore generating odd numbers. The question states that we want to store “ten consecutive even integers”, and therefore, it should be APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) as the first line of the missing code. . Question 43: . Explanation: . A simple misinterpretation of the question here; I put 6, since that is the value of x after the code is ran, not the result. The result would be the sum from 0 to 5, (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0), or 15 in option C. . Reflection: . My strengths included the binary questions and some of the simple if/else statements and the code execution programs. . Some of my difficulties included the multi-step code execution questions, but I will improve on this throughout the year. .",

We are all privileged in some way or the other, and it is crucial that we recognize that and be thankful for it. . We have to make a conscious effort to increase our wellbeing. Whether this is through exercising daily, meditating, or manifesting our goals, we have to prioritize our mental and physical health. . Personal Gratitude: . Personally, I am very grateful for the following things in my life: . Having a family that I can talk to and share experiences with | Having a home that I can return to everyday | Having access to a proper education everyday | Being friends with many great people | Having an abundant amount of food and clean water | . Group Stress Survey: . Our Scrum Board group (David, Akshat, Samit, and myself) created and analyzed a survey amongst many of our peers regarding their different contributing stress factors. . The survey results were documented by Samit in this post on his site. . The results showed that having a healthy social circle and life allows for a greater reduction of stress. From this survey, it is clear that ALL students should attempt to meet and socialize with good groups of people in order to take breaks from the rigor of daily schoolwork. .",

Effective collaboration allows for the proper reflection of a diversity of talents amongst groups of people | Collaboration also allows for a view into the differing perspectives of each person that contributed to a certain design/idea | Some interpersonal skills that can be developed through collaboration include communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiations | .

Pair Programming: Two programmers working together as a pair; one is actually writing code, the other is reviewing the work done by the other person (watching!) | Think-Pair-Share: Students are thinking through a problem alone, pairing with a partner to share ideas, and sharing the results with their peers | It is important to leave comments in the code! Always acknowledge other people’s code snippets (don’t steal). | It is important to get different perspectives when working on a design or program. | . Reflection Questions: . I believe that my Scrum Team is not strictly based on the basis of current friends and common interests. . Everyone in the group (Samit, Akshat, David, and myself) are all passionate about computer science, and are dedicated to working on our projects and going above and beyond the requirements for each week. . Our group is setup with diversity in our backgrounds and perspectives, but there is no diversity in our gender (we are all men). . Our group is best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in the classroom, as we are familiar with computer science and are always looking forward to new learning each week. . .",

Program Purpose and Function: | The program has inputs, outputs, and a generally efficient functionality. Points will NOT be given if the program is not shown to be running, or if the purpose described in the written response is just the functionality of the program. These are supposed to be two DIFFERENT things. . Data Abstraction: | The written response has to have two separate code segments; one that shows data being stored in a list, and another that shows data in the same list being used to accomplish the purpose of the program. . Managing Complexity: | The written response has to contain a list in the program that helps to manage the complexity (the lazy programmer way). This has to be EXPLAINED. . Procedural Abstraction: | Again, there must be two program code segments; one with a student-developed procedure on a parameter affecting program functionality, and another where that procedure is being called. . Algorithm Interpretation: | There must be a program code segment with a developed algorithm. This would have to contain sequencing, selection, and iterations. . For my Performance Task Creation with my partner, we are going to brainstorm throughout the week and come up with a plan to merge both of our AppLab ideas, and previous ideas from the Python Quiz from two weeks ago. . Bria’s Post Review: .

In the following demonstration, you will see that Samit and I have gathered each other&#39;s personal information, such as first name, last name, email, and many other components, and stored them as dictionary values using InfoDb. . Using the .append() method can be used to add multiple inputs. .

As per the name, loops are used to execute statement(s) more than once. . For loops are loops for an iterable object, or an object that can be looped over such as a list, dictionary, or string. These loops can perform the exact same action for each iterable object. . def for_loop(): for homie in InfoDb: print_data(homie) # Prints the data from InfoDb based on the index falling in the specified range. def indexed_for_loop(): print(&quot;For Loop n&quot;) for i in range(len(InfoDb)): print_data(InfoDb[i]) for_loop() indexed_for_loop() .

While Loops: . These are loops that repeat a particular statement when a specified condition is met (true). . def while_loops(): # This sets the initial value for the index at 0. i = 0 # When i &lt; dictionary length, the data from InfoDb will be printed. while i &lt; len(InfoDb): print_data(InfoDb[i]) i = i + 1 # Printing the while loop&#39;s output print(&quot;While Loop n&quot;) while_loops() .

Now, I&#39;d like to talk about a caveat that I used in the code. As you can all see, I defined &#39;integer&#39; as 3 at the start, even though there were 4 questions. This is because the 4th question was defined as a bonus question, and if someone got the bonus question right, they should get more than a 100%. . First, I tried without defining the integer value in the code and just adding the number 3 in the last print statement, but that did not work, as Python cannot concatenate an integer into a string value. Therefore, I had to define the integer as a string, and that made the print statement work without crashing at the end. . Thanks! .",

            "content": "Vardaan Sinha . Mr. Liao . AP Physics . 18 August 2022 . Lab #1: Measurements &amp; Graphical Analysis . Purpose Statement: The purpose of the lab is to find the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks and to calculate the uncertainty of the measured values through graphical analysis methods, such as linearization, where the graph shows a directly proportional relationship between the independent and dependent variables. . Derived Equation: . p = m/v → m = vp . | V = ah . | m = ( pi r^{2})hp . This equation shows that the mass of the disk is equal to the surface area of the disk (in other words, the area of a circle) multiplied by the height of the disk by the density of the disk. . | | Experiment Outline: . Measure the mass of the disk using the balance. Before using the balance, it must be zeroed, and then the disk can be placed on the balance. . | Measure the radius of the disk using the meter stick. The radius is measured by placing one end of the meter stick in the center of the circle, and the other end on the outside edge of the circle. . | Repeat Steps 1 &amp; 2 for each disk. . | Measure the thickness of one of the disks by folding the disk and measuring the height. Since the disk is folded to make it easier to find the height, divide the measurement appropriately to find the height if the disk was not folded. . | Graph the proportional mass vs radius2 relationship and determine the equation for the best-fit line. . | Precision: . The meter stick’s precision our group used was 1 millimeter (0.1 centimeters), since the meter stick used to measure the radius of the disks had markings down to the tenth of a centimeter. The measured radii of the disks in the data table is noted to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter, because of the 2/5/8 rounding rule, which added an extra digit of precision to the measurement. . | Data Table: . Radius2 (cm2) vs. Mass (grams) &amp; Radius (cm) . Radius (centimeters) Mass (grams)   Radius2 (centimeters2) . 5.32 cm | 0.37 g |   | 28.3024 cm2 | . 6.92 cm | 0.71 g |   | 47.8864 cm2 | . 4.12 cm | 0.25 g |   | 16.9744 cm2 | . 3.08 cm | 0.13 g |   | 9.4864 cm2 | . 2.28 cm | 0.08 g |   | 5.1984 cm2 | . . This is a nonlinear regression. . Equation: y = 0.0199151x2 - 0.0499334x + 0.095349 . . This is a linear regression. . Line of Best Fit Equation: y = 0.0146174x - 0.00729059 . Analysis Questions: . From the line of best fit, the independent variable represents the radius2 (centimeters2). This is because there is a linear relationship between the measured mass of each disk in grams and the corresponding squared radius values (in centimeters2) for each disk. . | The slope of the line of best fit has units of grams/cm2. In the original equation given in the lab, mass is equal to density multiplied by the disk’s surface area multiplied by the height of the disk. The surface area of the disk can be calculated through the formula for the area of the circle, or pi multiplied by the radius squared. Since the density, pi, and height values are all constant, they make up the coefficient for the slope of the line of best fit equation. Density is measured in grams/centimeter3, pi is a numerical constant, and height is measured in centimeters, and multiplying these values together gives units of grams/centimeter2. To verify that these are the correct units, the remaining part of the original equation is radius2, which has units of centimeters2, and multiplying the slope units (grams/centimeter2) by centimeters2 would produce a value in grams, which is the unit of measurement for m (mass). Since the y-value of the line of best fit equation has units of grams, the y-intercept (-0.00729059) must also be with units of grams, in order to produce the same unit on both sides of the equation: . In this case, g represents grams, and cm represents centimeters. . y = mx + b . | g = (g/cm2 * cm2) + g . | g = g + g . | g = g (verification) . | | | Yes, in ideal conditions, the “b” in the y = mx + b formula should be zero, as a disk with a radius of 0 centimeters would have a mass of 0 grams. . | Best-Fit Line Slope: 0.0146174 . The “thickness” of the cylinders is approximately 0.00125 centimeters. . | Density * ( pi) * Height = Slope . | Density * ( pi) * 0.00125 cm = 0.0146174 . | Density * 0.003925 cm = 0.0146174 . | Density = 3.72417834 ( approx) 3.72 g/cm3 . | The actual density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm3. . | Percent Error: (3.72 g/cm3 - 2.7 g/cm3)/(2.7 g/cm3) x 100% = 37.778% ( approx) 38% . | | Our calculated density for the aluminum foil disk (3.72 g/cm3) was slightly larger than the actual calculated density of aluminum (2.7 g/cm3), as shown by our positive 38% error. Our number was likely larger than the actual value because of the inability to accurately measure the height of each disk, leading to an under measurement, creating a higher density value than expected. Furthermore, the measurement of the disk area may have been slightly inaccurate due to each disk not being perfectly circular. . | Synthesis Questions: . Disks with a greater thickness would correspond to an increase in the slope of the best-fit line. A greater thickness with an unchanged radius would result in a greater volume of the disk, leading to an increase in the slope of the line. The experimental density would stay the same, since the increased thickness would be reflected in the increased slope of the line. The slope is equal to the density multiplied by pi (constant) by the thickness of the disk, and with the increased thickness already accounted for in the increased slope, the density would remain the same as before. Disks with a greater thickness would have allowed for a more accurate measurement of the height, creating a more accurate density measurement. . | In this modified graph, the purple line (also circled) represents a scenario in which steel disks with the same thickness were used in the experiment. The slope for the line representing the steel disks is steeper than the line for the aluminum foil disks, since the density of steel (7.85 g/cm3) is much greater than that of aluminum (2.7 g/cm3), and the slope is directly proportional to the density. The purple line in the above graph has a slope of approximately 2.9 times greater than the best fit line showing the relationship between mass and radius2, as the density of steel is 2.9 times greater than that of aluminum. . | Work: . Slope: 122 kg/m2 . | Thickness: 0.5 cm . | Density * ( pi) * Thickness = Slope . | Density * ( pi) * 0.5 cm = 122 kg/m2 . | Density * 1.57 cm = 122 kg/m2 . | 122 kg/m2 x (1.0 m2/10,000 cm2) x (1000 g/1.0 kg) = 12.2 g/cm2 . | Density * 1.57 cm = 12.2 g/cm2 . | Density = 7.77 g/cm3 . | This is closest to the density of iron, which is 7.8 g/cm3. Therefore, the unknown material that these disks are made of is iron. . | | Multiple Choice Questions: . Mass = Density * Volume . Density * Area * Height = Mass . | Density * ( pi)r2 * Height = Mass . | C = 2( pi)r . | C2 = 2( pi)r2 . | C2/(2( pi)) = r2 . | Density * ( pi)(C2/(2( pi))2) * Height = Mass . | Mass = (Density * Height * 1/4( pi)) * C2 . | Slope = (Density * Height)/(4( pi)) . | Therefore, E is the correct option. . | | SKIP . | Volume of a Sphere = 4/3( pi)r3 (r = radius) . Mass = Density * Volume . | Mass = Density * 4/3( pi)r3 . | Mass = (Density * 4/3( pi)) x r3 . | Since density and 4/3( pi) are constants, the mass would need to be plotted versus the radius3, so the correct option is C. . | |",

Key Terms Continued (Trimester Cumulative) . Collaboration: One of the keys when working with a team on code. It is the art of communication that is essential to making functional code. . | Flask: Web Application Framework that is important to develop web applications. . | Jinja2: The Web Template Language that is compatible with Flask and Python. . | Bootstrap: An HTML/CSS template engine that helps to create more aesthetically appealing sites. . | Pseudo Code: This is essentially another term used to describe the comments that are made to describe each line or functionality of code. . | JavaScript: Another programming language that is essential, especially for frontend developers. . | Procedural Abstraction: The practice of promoting reuse instead of continuously coding the same thing again and again. . | Agile Methodology: The use of pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints. This also includes well defined team roles. . | AWS: Amazon Web Services is a tool that allows for the deployment of our projects. It is a large part of the backend of our project. . | Nginx: An open source software used for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, etc. . | Certbot: This is another open source software tool that allows for encrypted certifications for hosted sites. . | DNS: DNS, or Domain Name Services, allows for the assignment of a friendly name to a web server. . | API: Application Programming Interface, it is a way for multiple programs to communicate/call each other. . | API URL: The endpoint to which the API is directed. . | API Headers: The dictionary data structure used to send special messaging to the endpoint. . | Document Object Model: The Document Object Model, or DOM, is the interaction between HTML and JavaScript. . | HTTP/HTTPS: HTTP, or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is in charge of the communication between a web server and web browser. HTTPS, on the other hand, is in charge for more secure communication between a web server and a web browser. . | TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol. These messages are divided into small packets and sent between computers on the Internet. . | Network Layer: The wireless and physical layers that move bits across the Internet. . | Unit 2 Binary Vocab . Bits: A bit can have only two states, on or off, which are commonly represented as ones and zeros. In our binary markdown we used to change the number of bits. . Bytes: Eight bits put together is known as a byte. A byte consists of 256 different combinations if you include the number 00000000 — all the binary numbers between 00000000 and 11111111. . HEX: Hexadecimal is base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. For example, when we use Javascript to change the color of the background on our blogs, we use hexadecimals like #eb4034, which would give us a red color. . Boolean: Basically binary, either true or false value . Unit 3 Vocab . Data Types: The type of data; integer, string, float, boolean, lists, dictionaries, arrays, etc. . Lists: Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. . Dictionary: A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. . Algorithm: Finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration. . Sequence: A code snippet type that is run only based on a conditional. . TYPES OF LOOPS: . For Loop: This loop repeats for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc. . While Loop: While loops are used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. A while loop will execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. . Extra Vocab: . STRING: A “string” of characters . Concatenation: This is where there is a combination of 2+ strings into a singular string. . Length: This function allows you to count the number of characters in the called string. . Substring: A partial snippet of an original string. . Upper Method: The upper() method returns the uppercase string from the given string. . Lower Method: The lower() method returns the lowercase string from the given string. . Comparison Operators: These are logical operators which allow for boolean outputs to be compared (hence the name). . Truth Table: A truth table is a way of checking circuitry logic. It goes through a series of conditions and then decides the output based on that. . If Statement: Conditional Statement . If Else Statement: This will check a statement REGARDLESS, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is met or not. .",
