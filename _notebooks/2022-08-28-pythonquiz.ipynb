    "Now, I'd like to talk about a caveat that I used in the code. As you can all see, I defined 'integer' as 3 at the start, even though there were 4 questions. This is because the 4th question was defined as a bonus question, and if someone got the bonus question right, they should get more than a 100%. \n",

    "First, I tried without defining the integer value in the code and just adding the number 3 in the last print statement, but that did not work, as Python cannot concatenate an integer into a string value. Therefore, I had to define the integer as a string, and that made the print statement work without crashing at the end. \n",
