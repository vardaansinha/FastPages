    "In the lesson, I learned about software libraries, the use for existing code segments, APIs, and the importance of documentation for these APIs and software libraries. First off, I learned that it is very useful to use existing procedures in code, as this can make the creation of the program more efficient. Furthermore, it is important to accompany these procedures with the proper documentation, which explains what the procedure is doing and what the program is attempting to accomplish. Furthermore, I also learned more about the \"random\" module that is often used in Python. It can serve as a random number generator and a number shuffler as well, which is very cool."

    "2. This procedure goes through a series of steps. First of all, the random module is imported to be used in this procedure. Then, an input is provided for the user to input everyone's names. The \"names\" variable is then defined as everyone's names split with a comma in between. Then, there is a variable defined as \"num_items\", which measures the number of names inputted. \n",

    "Then, the random module comes into place by selecting a random number in between 0 and the number of names - 1, inclusive. Then, in order to figure out the person who will pay the bill, the numbers corresponding to the names are randomized, and the name of the person that the code lands on is printed at the end."
