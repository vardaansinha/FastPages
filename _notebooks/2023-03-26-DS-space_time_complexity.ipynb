    "> Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the \"Big O\" notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity."

Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity.: **There are many different types of sorting algorithms, and each of them is more efficient than the other. Some types of sorting algorithms include the insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort algorithm. Out of these 6, the 3 most efficient sorts are the merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort algorithms.**\n",
    "- Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm?: **Time complexity is important when choosing an algorithm, as you want an algorithm that can be easily run without taking too much time to give you an output. Space complexity is also important, as you need an algorithm that can cover large amounts of data.**\n",
    "- Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? : **Constant time algorithms can be good most of the time, but they shouldn't always be used, as there could be algorithms which could take an even shorter amount of time. I would almost never use an exponential time algorithm, as they are almost always incredibly inefficient. For 512 inputs, a linear algorithm could take 512 seconds, while an exponential algorithm could take 1.34 x 10^154 seconds.**\n",
