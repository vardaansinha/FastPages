    "\n",
    "Building a simulation o#r interaction using lists and iteration in VS Code can be accomplished using a few simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define your data**: First, you need to define the data that your simulation will be working with. This could be a list of numbers, a list of strings, or any other type of data that your simulation will be manipulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write your simulation code:** Once you have defined your data, you can start writing the code for your simulation. This code will typically involve iterating over your list of data, performing some operation on each item in the list, and updating the list accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test your simulation:** After you have written your simulation code, it is important to test it to make sure it is working as expected. You can do this by running your code and checking the output to see if it matches what you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Refine your simulation:** Once you have tested your simulation, you may need to refine it based on the results. This could involve tweaking the code to make it more efficient, adding new features, or fixing any bugs that you have discovered.\n",

    "#### Why use simulations?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulations can be useful because they can emulate real world situations without needing excessive resources (ex: money), time, or equipment. For example, a simulation of the effectiveness of a new seatbelt or airbag can be performed by simulating car crashes. This would be better than doing it in real life because you wouldn't want to place people in cars and then crash them for obvious reasons.\n",
    "- However, simulatins do assume things about the real world and can have biases. They can be oversimplified because the real world often has more complications and factors that can affect something. In the case of our car crash simulation, other things can have a big impact, such as the weather and experience of the driver. However, these things can sometimes be held constant in the simulations."

    "Lists are ordered, and they have an index starting with 1 in the AP CSP course. Lists are just aggregations of values, such as a dataset, and are also mutable. Lists are very easy to use, create, and edit. However, it can be very inefficient to search for certain values in a list. Something great about lists is that they are ordered, so if a certain program requires an ordered dataset, lists are very easily implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, dictionaries are unordered, and they use key-value pairs rather than a starting index so to speak. Similar to lists, dictionaries are also mutable. Contrasting to lists, dictionaries are much more easy to sort through and find certain data values, since they are already organized through key-value pairs. However, a disadvantage of dictionaries that is not seen in lists, is that they are unordered, so for certain programs that need to have an ordered dataset as such, it is less efficient to use dictionaries.
